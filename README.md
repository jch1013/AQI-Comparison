# AQI-Comparison
** This project is a work in progress **

Purpose:
While most people know that poor air quality negatively affects health, it can be difficult to put the impact of poor air into perspective. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate to users the effects of poor air quality by equating AQI and exposure time to an estimated equivalent number of cigarettes smoked. 

Process:
The general process of equating air pollution to number of cigarettes begins with calculating the concentration of pollutants in the air based off the provided PM2.5 AQI value. The functions used to convert to pollutant concentration are based on calculations carried out on the airnow.gov website. After a concentration value is calculated, the provided exposure time is used along with the concentration value to estimate an equivalent number of cigarettes.
